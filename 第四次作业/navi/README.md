## Project Introduction
This project aims to develop a navigation system for the 4th floor of the Jishi Building, enabling users to virtually browse and access detailed information about each room. Through this system, users can gain comprehensive insights into the floor layout, including the purpose of each room and its assigned personnel. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily select a target room from an overview map of the floor or quickly locate specific rooms or individuals using the keyword search function. This greatly enhances the efficiency of navigation and overall user experience.
